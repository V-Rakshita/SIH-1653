## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

Developing a web-based interview platform that serves as the official system for structured and unbiased assessments. This platform is only accessible on designated office systems within the interview facility to ensure security,integrity and controlled access.

1. On-Premise Access: Candidates must physically attend the interview at the office, where the platform will be available in this web based application which is accessible only on the secured office systems. This ensures controlled access, prevents unauthorized use, and maintains data confidentiality.

2. AI-Driven Question Assistance: The interviewer actively asks questions, and the system assists by suggesting relevant ones in real time based on the candidate’s profile and prior responses. The AI evaluates both the interviewer’s and candidate’s inputs to ensure a structured interview process, starting with introductory questions and progressing to advanced topics.

3. Automated Scoring System: The AI evaluates the relevance of questions asked by the interviewer and the accuracy of responses from the candidate, generating a final performance score for unbiased assessment.

4. Real-Time Feedback & Warnings: If an interviewer asks irrelevant or off-topic questions, they receive automated warnings. Similarly, if the candidate's responses are not aligned with the question, they are notified in real-time to maintain quality discussions.

5. Manual Recording Activation: To ensure privacy and security, the AI only listens and processes responses when explicitly enabled through a manual recording activation button at the start of the interview. This ensures the system is only active when needed and prevents unauthorized data capture.

6. Integrated Video Conferencing: The platform includes secure video conferencing, eliminating the need for third-party tools like Zoom. This provides a seamless and secure interview experience, with role-based access control to restrict unauthorized users.

7. Multi-Level Interview Support: The system supports technical, managerial, and HR-based interviews, adjusting the complexity of questions accordingly. It ensures that the interview flow adapts to different levels of expertise and roles.

8. Final Evaluation & Reporting: The system compiles detailed performance reports, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and key improvement areas for each candidate. This assists recruiters in making data-driven hiring decisions.
 
The web application therefore, serves as the official interview platform, specifically designed for conducting structured and unbiased assessments. This platform is only accessible on designated office systems to ensure security and integrity.
